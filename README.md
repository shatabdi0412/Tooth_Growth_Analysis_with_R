#  Tooth Growth Analysis of Pigs

In this project, we are going to analyize the tooth growth of pigs by using statistical inferences. We have used the sample dataset of 60 guinea pigs which is available in R lanaguage's sample datasets.
We perform a basic inferential data analysis on the ToothGrowth data set in R. In this data set, the length of odontoblasts (teeth) were measured in each of 10 guinea pigs at each of three doses of Vitamin C (0.5, 1 and 2 mg) with each of two supplements (Orange Juice or Ascorbic Acid).

# About Dataset
